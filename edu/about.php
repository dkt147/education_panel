                we employ Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) with image and data processing techniques to implement a general purpose automated Plant identification for which user can analyze the growth rate of plant which is required in that entered area. The classification features are the set of time series values, built by the sequence of images, and geographic coordinate of field – latitude.

              </p>

                It takes a lot of time and man power to identify the areas where plants are to be planted. People keep planting trees In the same area where plants are already been planted they do not have an idea where the need of plantation.
